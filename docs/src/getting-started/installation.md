# Installation

This guide covers installation for the **nmrs library**.

### Using Cargo

The easiest way to add nmrs to your project:

```bash
cargo add nmrs
```

Or manually add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
nmrs = "3.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

`nmrs` is async and ships no runtime of its own. The examples in this book
use [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) but `nmrs` works with any reactor that is
compatible with the [`zbus`](https://docs.rs/zbus) executor (Tokio,
`async-std`, `smol`, …). See [Async Runtime Support](../advanced/async-runtimes.md).

### From Source

Clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freedesktop-rs/nmrs.git
cd nmrs/nmrs
cargo build --release
```

### Verify Installation

Create a simple test to verify nmrs is working:

```rust
use nmrs::NetworkManager;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> nmrs::Result<()> {
    let nm = NetworkManager::new().await?;
    println!("nmrs is working!");
    Ok(())
}
```

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (any modern distribution)
- **Rust**: 1.90.0 or later
- **NetworkManager**: Version 1.0 or later, running and accessible via D-Bus
- **D-Bus**: System bus must be available

## Permissions

nmrs requires permission to manage network connections. On most systems, this is handled by PolicyKit. Ensure your user is in the appropriate groups:

```bash
# Check if you're in the network group
groups

# Add yourself to the network group if needed (requires logout/login)
sudo usermod -aG network $USER
```

## Verify NetworkManager

Ensure NetworkManager is running:

```bash
systemctl status NetworkManager
```

If it's not running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager  # Start on boot
```
