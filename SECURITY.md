# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and provide security updates for the latest version of nmrs. 
We strongly recommend keeping your nmrs dependencies up to date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in nmrs or any of the related crates, please report it privately by emailing
**alhakimiakrmjATgmailDOTcom**.

Please include the following information in your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and attack scenarios
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up questions

### What constitutes a security vulnerability?

For nmrs, security vulnerabilities may include but are not limited to:

- **Authentication bypass**: Ability to connect to protected networks without proper credentials
- **Privilege escalation**: Unauthorized access to NetworkManager operations that should require elevated permissions
- **Credential exposure**: Leaking WiFi passwords, VPN keys, or other sensitive connection data through logs, errors, or memory
- **D-Bus injection**: Malicious D-Bus messages that could manipulate network connections or device state
- **Denial of service**: Crashes, hangs, or resource exhaustion that prevent legitimate network management
- **Information disclosure**: Exposing network SSIDs, MAC addresses, or connection details to unauthorized processes
- **Input validation failures**: Improper handling of malformed SSIDs, credentials, or configuration data leading to undefined behavior
- **Race conditions**: Timing vulnerabilities in connection state management that could lead to security issues
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Security issues in upstream crates (zbus, tokio, etc.) that affect nmrs

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within
  **24 hours**
- **Initial assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment of the report within
  **5 business days**
- **Regular updates**: We will provide progress updates at least every **7 days** until
  resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to provide a fix or mitigation within **30 days** for critical
  vulnerabilities

Response times may vary based on the complexity of the issue and availability of maintainers.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Private disclosure**: We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability
2. **Fix development**: We will develop and test a fix in a private repository if necessary
3. **Coordinated release**: We will coordinate the public disclosure with the release of a fix
4. **Public disclosure**: After a fix is available, we will publish a security advisory

We request that you:
- Give us reasonable time to address the vulnerability before making it public
- Avoid accessing or modifying data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Act in good faith and avoid privacy violations or destructive behavior
